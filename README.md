# (GitHub Action) Version Branch

[![GitHub Release](https://img.shields.io/github/package-json/v/fortinet/github-action-version-branch)]()
[![Node version](https://img.shields.io/badge/node-^12.10-brightgreen.svg?style=flat)]()

A GitHub Action that resolves a version branch (aka: head branch), and a set of version details for a semver-style head version.

The name of the `head branch`, and the the `head version` are both resolved by the given inputs. They remain idempotent and can be passed down to any other action in a workflow.

If the `head branch` already exists, it returns the existing branch, otherwise, a new branch will be created and returned. Therefore, an indicator `is-new-branch` will be provided. Even though this action may resolve to an existing `head branch`, it does not do `git diff` between the `base branch` and the `head branch`.

The `head version` is resolved to a semver (see: [semver.org](semver.org)) with the given inputs. It returns details including: `major`, `minor`, `patch`, `pre-id`, `pre-num`, `is-prerelease`.


## Usage

```yaml
- uses: fortinet/github-action-version-branch@main
  with:
    # The GitHub automatically created secret to use in your workflow for authentications.
    # see: https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/authentication-in-a-workflow
    # Can be obtained from ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}.
    # Must be provided explicitly.
    # Required. No default.
    github-token: ''
    # The base branch that the pull request will be going to.
    # Required. No default.
    base-branch: ''
    # The name prefix to include in the new branch name.
    # The new branch name format is: <prefix><version>. Example: Rel_branch1.0.0-rc.1
    # The version will be retrieved from the base-branch, bumped according to the version-level.
    # Optional. Default: 'rel_'.
    name-prefix: 'rel_'
    # The level of the semver version.
    # Accepted inputs: major, minor, patch, and prerelease.
    # Optional. No default.
    version-level: ''
    # A valid semver pre-release identifier.
    # Used in command: npm version --preid=<pre-id>
    # If specified, the versioning behavior will become
    #  'premajor', 'preminor', 'prepatch', and 'prerelease'.
    # Required. No default.
    pre-id: ''
    # The custom version to bump to. If specified, it will be used as the version.
    # It needs to be a valid semver format.
    # Optional. No default.
    custom-version: ''
    # The pull request number for info retrieval uses. If present, the information will be returned
    # in the action output, and no new branch will be created as opposed to creating a new branch by
    # default without the pr-number.
    # Optional. No default.
    pr-number: ''
```
